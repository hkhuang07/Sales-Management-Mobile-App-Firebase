## üöÄ Project Overview

This mobile application provides a robust and intuitive platform for managing sales and products directly from an Android device. It features a clear distinction between administrative and regular user functionalities, making it versatile for various roles within a sales ecosystem. A core strength of this project lies in its seamless integration with **Google Firebase**, leveraging its powerful **Authentication** for secure user access and **Cloud Firestore** for flexible, real-time data storage.

This approach ensures a scalable, reliable, and modern backend solution, allowing the app to handle user authentication, product catalogs, shopping carts, and order management with ease and efficiency.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy of this project up and running on your development machine, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* **Android Studio Arctic Fox** or newer
* **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11** or newer
* A **Google Firebase Project** (properly set up for Android)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/hkhuang07/Sales-Management-Mobile-App-Firebase.git](https://github.com/hkhuang07/Sales-Management-Mobile-App-Firebase.git)
    ```
2.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    Open the cloned project folder in Android Studio.
3.  **Set up Firebase:**
    * Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    * Create a new Firebase project (if you don't have one).
    * Add an Android app to your Firebase project.
    * Follow the instructions to download your `google-services.json` file.
    * Place `google-services.json` into your `app/` directory of the Android Studio project.
    * **Enable the following services in your Firebase project:**
        * **Authentication:** Enable Email/Password and Google Sign-in providers.
        * **Cloud Firestore:** Initialize a Firestore database.
        * **Cloud Messaging:** Enable this service for push notifications.
    * **Set up Firestore Security Rules:** Configure appropriate security rules in your Firestore database to control read/write access. For basic functionality, you might start with rules that allow authenticated users to read and write specific collections, and admin users to have broader access. (E.g., `match /users/{userId} { allow read, write: if request.auth != null; }`, `match /products/{productId} { allow read: if true; allow write: if request.auth.token.admin == true; }`).
4.  **Sync Gradle:**
    Allow Android Studio to sync the project with Gradle files to download all necessary dependencies.
5.  **Run the app:**
    Connect an Android device or use an emulator, then click the "Run" button in Android Studio.
